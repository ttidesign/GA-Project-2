## Project proposal

For this project I'm thinking of doing one of these two. Recipe search website or Movie search website.
I have to test API to see which one give me the result data that I can work with.

MVP: The webite will have 4 react components App-Navigation-Mainpage-Individual Page.
The App component should render Nav and Mainpage where Mainpage is the container of images. The search results will be rendered via Mainpage.
When click on an item it should take user to the correct page display information about the clicked item. Nav should display on
every page so users can navigate back to the home page.

Silver Goal: Adding an additional component that allow user to save Recipe/Movie and keep it there as long as the site is running.
Gold Goal: Have side bar that implement fillter search
Platnum: Allow users to create account to store recipes/movies

Below is a simple diagram of the components and my thought process when planning for the components hierarchy.

## Wirefame

I created the basic layout using wireframing method to ideate the website looks and feel, placing each individual items
and element of show they should display on the page. This is a starter and could slightly change over time as project progress.
